# KPMG-Challeges
This repository is solely intended for housing the answers/approaches for challenges shared for the KPMG Tech Challenge.

Challenge #1
A 3 tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.

 
Challenge #2
Summary
We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within aws and provide a json formatted output. The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

 
Challenge #3
We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
